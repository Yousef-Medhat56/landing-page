Practising on HTML and CSS basics after finishing an online course

## What is this?
This project is an application built for developing my HTML and CSS skills.

## The sources that I depended on :
* The main idea of the project and the images(but I applicated it with my own code) : https://youtu.be/j_Xa7Kn59Es.
* The JavaScript of the nav bar : https://youtu.be/gXkqy0b4M5g.
* The hover effect : https://youtu.be/MLfAW55_4cY.

### What I focused on:
* Making the website responsive.
* Using CSS Flex properly.
* Adding nice appearing for the website.

### What I need to focus on:
* Adding comments.
* Using Git.
